abstract: Aberrant attentional biases to social stimuli have been implicated in a
  number of disorders including autism and social anxiety disorder. Oxytocin, a naturally-occurring
  mammalian hormone and neuromodulator involved in regulating social behavior, has
  been proposed to impact basic biological systems that facilitate the detection of
  and orientation to social information. Here, we investigate a role for naturally-occurring
  variability in the endogenous oxytocinergic system in regulating neural response
  during attention to social information. Participants performed a selective social
  attention task while undergoing fMRI, provided a blood sample for epigenetic analysis,
  and completed self-report measures of social functioning. We find that a functional
  epigenetic modification to the oxytocin receptor, OXTR methylation, is associated
  with increased neural response within and decreased functional coupling between
  regions of the salience and attentional control networks during selective social
  attention. We also show that subclinical variability in autistic and social anxiety
  traits moderates this epigenetic regulation of neural response. These data offer
  a mechanistic explanation to a growing literature associating social behavior and
  disorder with epigenetic modification to OXTR by suggesting that OXTR methylation
  reflects a decrease in the extent to which social information automatically captures
  attention. We highlight the importance that treatment efficacy be considered in
  relation to individual differences in molecular makeup, and that future studies
  aimed at uncovering biomarkers of disorder carefully consider measurement at both
  the biological and phenotypic level.
