abstract: Neuroimaging epigenetics is an interdisciplinary application of epigenetics
  to cognitive neuroscience that seeks to identify molecular and neural predictors
  of human behavior. This approach can be sensitive to the dynamic interaction between
  biological predisposition and environmental influences, and is potentially more
  informative than an approach using static genetic code. Recent work in this field
  has generated considerable enthusiasm, yet caution is warranted since any novel
  cross-disciplinary approach lacks a set of established conventions or standards.
  In this paper we review existing research in the field of imaging epigenetics, outline
  important caveats and considerations, and suggest a set of guidelines for researchers
  conducting this work.
