abstract: In humans, the neuropeptide oxytocin plays a critical role in social and
  emotional behavior. The actions of this molecule are dependent on a protein that
  acts as its receptor, which is encoded by the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR). DNA
  methylation of OXTR, an epigenetic modification, directly influences gene transcription
  and is variable in humans. However, the impact of this variability on specific social
  behaviors is unknown. We hypothesized that variability in OXTR methylation impacts
  social perceptual processes often linked with oxytocin, such as perception of facial
  emotions. Using an imaging epigenetic approach, we established a relationship between
  OXTR methylation and neural activity in response to emotional face processing. Specifically,
  high levels of OXTR methylation were associated with greater amounts of activity
  in regions associated with face and emotion processing including amygdala, fusiform,
  and insula. Importantly, we found that these higher levels of OXTR methylation were
  also associated with decreased functional coupling of amygdala with regions involved
  in affect appraisal and emotion regulation. These data indicate that the human endogenous
  oxytocin system is involved in attenuation of the fear response, corroborating research
  implicating intranasal oxytocin in the same processes. Our findings highlight the
  importance of including epigenetic mechanisms in the description of the endogenous
  oxytocin system and further support a central role for oxytocin in social cognition.
  This approach linking epigenetic variability with neural endophenotypes may broadly
  explain individual differences in phenotype including susceptibility or resilience
  to disease.
