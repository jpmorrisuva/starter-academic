abstract: 'Oxytocin has anxiolytic properties whose mechanisms of action are still
  being identified. DNA methylation in the promoter region of the oxytocin receptor
  gene (OXTR), an epigenetic modification that putatively reflects a downtuning of
  the oxytocin system, has previously been implicated in the regulation of fear-related
  responses through the amygdala. In this study, we attempted to characterize the
  relationship between methylation of OXTR and anxiogenesis using two distinct endophenotypes:
  autonomic nervous system activity and subcortical brain structure. In 79 participants,
  we found that increased OXTR methylation is associated with attenuated resting parasympathetic
  tone, measured using high-frequency heart rate variability. Further, we found that
  this relationship is mediated by brain morphology, such that OXTR methylation is
  associated with increased gray matter of the central amygdala which is, in turn,
  associated with decreased parasympathetic tone. These results further our understanding
  of epigenetic regulation of the human oxytocin system and its role in anxiogenesis.'
